# Chapter 1: Beginning Git

## Why do we need Version Control?
There are 3 main benefits of using version control like git
1. **Retain history of changes** We can save our progress in the form of snapshots
2. **Safety net** We can revert back to previous snapshots if we make a mistake
3. **Teamwork** Git allows us to collaborate with others

#### My personal advantages
1. heatmap of commits to keep me motivated
2. Access of my code from multiple devices

## Getting Started with git
To start working with git you need to convert your project into a git repo, to do that, run the `git init` command at the top level of your project.



### Command line basics
- `pwd` **print working directory** tells you where you are in the file system
- `mkdir FOLDER-NAME` **make directory** creates a folder
- `ls` **list directory** outputs the files and folder in the current directory.
    - `-A` flag used to outputs **All**  files including **hidden** files
